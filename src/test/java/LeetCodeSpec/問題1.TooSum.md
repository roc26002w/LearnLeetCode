# Problem 1 Too Sum


Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.<br>
給予一組整數陣列及一個數字，這個數字將是陣列中隨便二個數的相加，並回傳此二數的key 值

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.<br>
必需要符合下面的範例

Example:

```
	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].
```
