#Problem 341 Flatten Nested List Iterator

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.
給定一組數字陣列，將它們拆成1階陣列

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:
Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]],

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
輸出為 [1,1,2,1,1]
Example 2:
Given the list [1,[4,[6]]],

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
輸出為 [1,4,6]
